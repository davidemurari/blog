    "text": "I am Davide Murari, and I am from Italy. I like reading, running and trying to explain what I know online. I’m a second-year PhD student in the group of Differential Equations and Numerical Analysis (DNA) at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.\nBoth my Bachelor degree and my Master degree were in Applied Mathematics, at the University of Verona, Italy. During the master, I had the opportunity of attending the Modelling week at Grenoble and spending five months in Nice (at the University of Cote d’Azur) for the Erasmus program. My bachelor thesis was on dynamical billiards, while the master’s one on the theory of integrability of non-Hamiltonian dynamical systems.\nDuring university, I developed a great interest in dynamical systems and geometric mechanics. In the DNA group here at NTNU, I found the opportunity of merging these two interests with the one of numerical implementation. My PhD thesis will focus on\nanalysing deep neural networks from the perspective of dynamical systems and data-driven modelling for mechanical systems.\nThe current draft of the thesis’ title is “From dynamical systems to deep learning and back: network architectures based on vector fields and data-driven modelling”.\nBy dynamical systems’ approach to deep learning, I refer to their possible interpretation as non-autonomous parametric ODEs. Indeed, this comes thinking to neural networks having infinitely many layers, where time is considered a measure of the depth of the network, having hence infinitely many layers.  Therefore, for example, we can think of the challenge of binary classification of points of the plane as “learning a vector field whose flow moves the points so that a hyperplane can separate the two labelled groups”.\nThanks to this construction, many relevant questions and techniques typical of ODEs and Numerical analysis arise in this research area and make me interested in these problems. Therefore, in this research project, I want to use dynamical systems to study deep learning architectures and attempt to explain their training and reliability as predictive tools.\nSuch a poweful connections between these fields, goes also in the opposite direction. Indeed, with the increasing amount of data we are able to collect nowadays, it becomes interesting to answer to the two following questions - can we approximate the vector fields generating a set of measured trajectories? - can we approximate the solutions to PDEs and ODEs using hybrid approaches involving data driven techniques and numerical analysis? During my PhD I am to investigate these two questions from different angles, and you can already see some work in this direction in the Academic Works page of the website.\nFurthermore, there are many applications where the data are manifold-valued, and hence the forward propagation in the neural network should remain on that manifold. Neural networks on manifolds are still an area with not too many results, but with clear potential, so the plan is to investigate this problem throughout the four years of the PhD.\nI created this presonal website to keep track of my research work, improve my writing and share what I learn during the process in the Blog section. I hope to get in touch with many other researchers interested in the topics on which I am working, possibly starting some nice collaborations."

    "text": "Real-world physical systems can be usually modelled by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in some Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) or on some embedded submanifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\). The solutions of these ODEs can also be geometrically characterized as integral curves of some vector field \\(X\\in\\mathfrak{X}(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) or \\(X\\in\\mathfrak{X}(\\mathcal{M})\\). Here, by integral curves, we mean curves to which \\(X\\) is pointwise tangent. These systems usually can not be solved analytically, but such solutions can be approximated using some numerical integrator, for example, the simple explicit-Euler method. More often than not, physical systems also have some characteristic properties. For example, they can conserve some energy function, or be Hamiltonian, or be the gradient of some scalar function. When this is the case, it might be relevant to reproduce such behaviour even in the numerical approximation of its solutions. The area of numerical analysis that focuses on this last aspect is usually called “Geometric numerical integration”. In this post we will focus on the specific case in which a vector field \\(X\\in\\mathfrak{X}(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) preserves the spheres \\(S^{n-1}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\) or, in other words, has \\(I(x) = |x|^2\\) as a conserved quantity. Vector fields satisfying this property are all and only those satisfying \\(\\nabla I(x)^T X(x) = 2x^TX(x)=0\\), i.e. they are pointwise orthogonal to \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\). This article covers some numerical approaches reproducing this behaviour in the discrete solution. One of the reported solutions involves implicit numerical methods, while two others can be based on explicit Runge–Kutta methods. I want to highlight that these 3 strategies are by no means the only ones known. For example, a relevant family of integrators that I do not discuss are projection methods."

    "text": "Conditions on classical Runge–Kutta methods\nA classical Runge–Kutta method of \\(s-\\)stages, is characterized by a matrix \\(A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{s\\times s}\\) and two vectors \\(b,c\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\) that together define the Butcher’s tableau of the method. The way in which these 3 elements are involved for the solution approximation of \\(X\\in\\mathfrak{X}(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\), is determined by the following discrete update: \\[x_{k+1}= \\varphi_h(x_k) = x_k + h \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i X(x_{k,i}), \\,\\, x_{k,i} = x_k + h\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} X(x_{k,j}).\\] Since we are considering autonomous dynamical systems, the \\(c\\) vector is not involved here. This family of numerical integrators can preserve all linear first integrals; however, not all the methods can preserve all quadratic first integrals. For this to happen, there has to be a specific algebraic relation between \\(A\\) and \\(b\\). We first introduce it and then prove that the Runge–Kutta method preserves the desired conserved quantity with this structure. Let \\(B\\) be the diagonal matrix having \\(b\\) on the diagonal. Then, a Runge–Kutta method of Tableau \\((A,b,c)\\) preserves all the quadratic first integrals of \\(X\\) if and only if \\[ A^TB+BA-bb^T=0. \\] This relation can be translated into \\(a_{ij}b_i + a_{ji}b_j - b_ib_j = 0\\) for any \\(i,j=1,...,s\\). We now prove this fact, but first, we notice that this can not be true if \\(A\\) is lower triangular, i.e. if the Runge–Kutta method is explicit. For simplicity, we restrict to the first integral \\(I(x)=\\|x\\|^2\\); however, the same reasoning can be extended to \\(I_S(x)=x^TSx\\) for every symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix \\(S\\). Since the problem we consider is autonomous, to achieve what we want is enough to check that \\(I(x_1)=I(x_0)\\): \\[\n\\begin{split}\nI(x_1) &= x_1^Tx_1 = \\langle x_0 + h\\sum_{i=1}^s b_i X(x_{0,i}), x_0 + h\\sum_{j=1}^s b_j X(x_{0,j}) \\rangle \\\\\n&=I(x_0) + 2h\\sum_{i}b_{i}\\langle x_0 ,X(x_{0,i}) \\rangle + h^2\\sum_{i,j}b_ib_j\\langle X(x_{0,i}),X(x_{0,j}) \\rangle\n\\end{split}\n\\] We now introduce, with a simple trick, the terms \\(a_{ij}\\). Indeed, we recall \\[\nx_{0,i} = x_0 + h\\sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij}X(x_{0,j})\\implies x_0 = x_{0,i}-h\\sum_{j}a_{ij}X(x_{0,j}).\n\\] We hence replace this expression, in place of \\(x_{0}\\) in the previously obtained result: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nI(x_1) &= I(x_0) + 2h\\sum_{i}b_{i}\\langle x_{0,i}-h\\sum_{j}a_{ij}X(x_{0,j}) ,X(x_{0,i}) \\rangle +\\\\ &+h^2\\sum_{i,j}b_ib_j\\langle X(x_{0,i}),X(x_{0,j}) \\rangle = \\\\\n&= I(x_0) - 2h^2 \\sum_{i,j}b_ia_{ij}\\langle X(x_{0,j}).X(x_{0,i})\\rangle + h^2\\sum_{i,j}b_ib_j\\langle X(x_{0,i}),X(x_{0,j}) \\rangle .\n\\end{split}\n\\] Here, one term vanished because \\(\\nabla I(z)^TX(z)=z^TX(z)=0\\) for any \\(z\\). We then can conclude noticing that this expression can be rewritten as follows \\[\nI(x_1) = I(x_0) - h^2 \\sum_{i,j} \\left(b_ia_{ij}+b_ja_{ji}-b_ib_j\\right)\\langle X(x_{0,i}),X(x_{0,j}) \\rangle = I(x_0)\n\\] by splitting the first term into two equal parts and exchanging (in one of them) the \\(i\\) with the \\(j\\). A simple example of a Runge–Kutta method that satisfies this property is the implicit Mid-Point method, a \\(1-\\)stage method with Tableau \\(A=c=1/2\\), \\(b=1\\). Thus \\[\nA^TB+BA-bb^T = \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}-1 = 0\n\\] as desired."

    "text": "Preserve quadratic invariants with modifications of explicit Runge–Kutta methods\nAll the Runge–Kutta methods that satisfy the condition introduced in the previous section have to be implicit. Sometimes, it is not desirable to use implicit methods; however, one might still be interested in preserving quadratic invariants, as \\(|x|^2\\). In this section, we briefly go through a result introduced in the paper [1], where a more general theory is also developed. Consider an explicit Runge–Kutta method with \\(s\\) stages \\[x_{k+1}= \\varphi_h(x_k) = x_k + h \\sum_{i=1}^s b_i X(x_{k,i})\\] with \\[ x_{k,i} = x_k + h\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} X(x_{k,j})\\] being the internal stages. It is simple to notice that in general \\(|\\varphi_h(x_k)|^2\\neq |x_k|^2\\) and hence that the quadratic first integral of \\(X\\) is not discretely preserved. The question is now: how can we slightly modify \\(\\varphi_h\\) to preserve \\(|x|^2\\) still getting a consistent approximation of the analytical solution? To do so, we introduce can a scalar value \\(\\gamma_k\\) as \\[\\tilde{\\varphi}_h (x_k) = (1-\\gamma_k)\\varphi_h(x_k) + \\gamma_k x_k.\\] By replacing \\[\\gamma_k = \\frac{|\\varphi_h(x_k)|^2 - |x_k|^2}{|\\varphi_h(x_k)-x_k|^2}\\] in the previous expression, one can verify that \\(|x|^2\\) will be preserved by \\(\\tilde{\\varphi}_h\\). Moreover, it is possible to prove that if the base method \\(\\varphi_h\\) has order \\(p\\geq 2\\), the perturbation \\(\\tilde{\\varphi}_h\\) will have order \\(p-1\\). It is important to remark that this construction is based on one assumption on \\(\\varphi_h\\). Indeed, call \\(h\\Delta_k = \\varphi_h(x_k) - x_k\\), then we suppose \\[\\langle x_k, \\Delta_k\\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\Delta_k,\\Delta_k\\rangle\\neq 0.\\] This, for example, says that the construction is not well defined for explicit-Euler where \\(\\Delta_k = X(x_k)\\) and it hence holds \\(\\langle \\Delta_k , x_k\\rangle = 0\\) since \\(|x|^2\\) is a first integral of \\(X\\). An example for which this reasoning can be applied is the Euler-Heun method of order 2. Such a method writes \\[\n\\quad x_{n,2} = x_n + h X(x_n),\\quad x_{n+1} = x_n + \\frac{h}{2}\\left(X(x_n) + X(x_{n,2})\\right) = \\varphi_h(x_n)\n\\] and the modification \\(\\tilde{\\varphi}_h\\) can be defined as above. I applied such a modified Euler-Heun method to the simple linear ODE \\(\\dot{x}(t) = (B-B^T)x(t) = X(x(t))\\), where \\(B\\) is a randomly generated matrix. This vector field preserves the function \\(|x|^2\\) and we see from the plots below that also the numerical solution does it when computed with \\(\\tilde{\\varphi}_h\\). As a comparison, I report the plot also for the classical Runge–Kutta method of order 4, based on the default implementation in SciPy of Python."

    "text": "Lie group methods\nIn this last section, we are briefly going through a third possible solution to the problem of preserving the first integral \\(I(x)=\\|x\\|^2\\). The term “Lie group methods” encapsulates a lot of different approaches. If one wants to read more about them, I suggest some references here : [2], [3], [4], [5].\nWe briefly see the idea and how to transform any Runge-Kutta method into an integrator preserving \\(I(x)\\). We do this by introducing the notion of homogeneous manifold and of transitive Lie group action.\nGiven a manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), we say it to be homogeneous if there can be defined a Lie group action \\(\\varphi: G\\times \\mathcal{M}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{M}\\) that is transitive. With transitive group action, we mean an action that allows moving any point \\(m\\in \\mathcal{M}\\) into any other \\(m'\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) through the action of some group element \\(g\\in G\\). More concisely, \\(\\varphi\\) is transitive if and only if\n\\[\n\\forall m,m'\\in\\mathcal{M}\\,\\,\\exists g\\in G\\text{ such that }\\varphi(g,m)=m'.\n\\]\nThe sphere \\(S_r^2\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3\\) of radius \\(r>0\\) is a simple example of homogeneous manifold. Indeed, let \\(G=SO(3)\\) be the special orthogonal group, made by orthogonal matrices that preserve the orientation, i.e. rotation matrices. Then, we can define\n\\[\n\\varphi: SO(3)\\times S_r^2 \\rightarrow S_r^2,\\,\\,(R,x)\\mapsto Rx.\n\\]\nThis is a group action since \\(R=I_3\\), the identity matrix, it sends \\(x\\) into itself. Moreover, we have \\(\\varphi(R_2,\\varphi(R_1,x)) = R_2R_1x = \\varphi(R_2R_1,x)\\). To check its transitivity, there are various approaches that work. For simplicity, we now work with \\(S_r^2\\) embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), i.e. \\(S^2_r = \\{g^{-1}(\\{0\\}):\\, g(x)=\\|x\\|^2-r,\\,x\\in\\mathbb{R}^3\\}\\), use the coordinates of the ambient space and set \\(r=1\\) denoting \\(S^2_1=S^2\\). We then show that \\(e_1=(1,0,0)\\in S^2\\) can be sent to any point \\(v\\in S^2\\) thanks to some rotation matrix \\(M_v\\in SO(3)\\). From this, to prove that for any pair \\(x,y\\in S^2\\) there exists \\(R_{xy}\\in SO(3)\\) so that \\(R_{xy}x = y\\), we can simply set \\(R_{xy} = M_yM_x^{-1}\\). Indeed, \\(R_{xy}x = M_yM_x^{-1}x=M_ye_1=y\\) as desired.\nTo build this \\(M_v\\), we can define the vector \\(v\\in S^2\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3\\) in terms of its ambient space coordinates \\(v=(v_x,v_y,v_z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3\\). Then, we see that if  \\(M_ve_1=v\\), necessarily the first column of \\(M_v\\) has to be \\(v\\). Then, we just have to complete \\(M_v\\) to an orthogonal matrix with two other orthonormal vectors as second and third columns. The extension to a generic radius \\(r>0\\) is immediate.\nThe reason why \\(S_r^2\\) matters, in the preservation of \\(I(x)\\), is that when a vector field \\(X\\in\\mathbb{R}^3\\) has \\(I\\) as a conserved quantity, it is tangent to the spheres of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). Indeed, having a conserved quantity \\(I\\) for a dynamics means that such a dynamics preserves the level sets of \\(I\\). The level sets of \\(I(x)\\) are spheres of radius \\(r\\) determined by the initial condition. In other  words, we have that\n\\[\nx_0\\in S_r^2 \\implies x(t) \\in S^2_r\\,\\forall t\\geq 0\n\\]\nif\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x}(t) = X(x(t)),\\\\\nx(0) = x_0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nA Lie group \\(G\\) can be associated with its Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\simeq T_e G\\). To map objects in \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) to those in \\(G\\), there are various mappings available, however, we now focus on the exponential map \\(\\exp:\\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow G\\) that is a local diffemorphism about the identity element of \\(G\\).  For matrix Lie groups, this is simply the matrix exponential\n\\[\n\\exp(A) = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{A^k}{k!}.\n\\]\nThe Lie algebra of \\(SO(3)\\), denoted with \\(\\mathfrak{so}(3)\\), is the vector space of skew-symmetric matrices. Indeed, we have that for any matrix \\(A=B-B^T\\in\\mathfrak{so}(3)\\),\n\\[\n\\exp(A)\\in SO(3).\n\\]\nThe main idea of one class of Lie group integrators is to locally transfer the dynamics from the homogeneous manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to the Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) of the Lie group \\(G\\) acting transitively on it. On this linear space \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) we then perform one time-step with some Runge–Kutta method and then bring such updated position back to \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). To work with this framework with an arbitrary Runge–Kutta method, we would need a more detailed presentation, however, for explicit-Euler, this can be seen in a quite simple way.\nThe most difficult task among those presented in the previous paragraph is the one of lifting/transferring the dynamics on the Lie algebra. This is done thanks to the infinitesimal generator of the group action \\(\\varphi\\) defined as\n\\[\n\\varphi_*(\\xi)(x) = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}\\Big\\vert_{\\varepsilon=0}\\varphi(\\exp(t\\xi),x)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\xi\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\) and \\(x\\in\\mathcal{M}\\). Because of the transitivity of the group action, it can be proven that \\(\\forall Y\\in\\mathfrak{X}(\\mathcal{M})\\), there is a function \\(f_Y:\\mathcal{M}\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}\\) such that\n\\[\n\\varphi_*(f_Y(x))(x) = Y(x),\\quad \\forall x\\in\\mathcal{M}.\n\\]\nFor the sake of completeness, I write the lifted ODE on \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) coming from this function we have just introduced. However, this expression simplifies considerably when we are just interested in one step with explicit-Euler method.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{\\xi}(t) = d\\exp_{\\xi(t)}^{-1}\\circ f \\circ \\varphi(\\exp(\\xi(t)),x)\\in T_{\\xi(t)}\\mathfrak{g},\\\\\n\\xi(0) = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe idea of some Lie group methods is hence to perform one time step of this ODE with some Runge–Kutta method to get an approximation \\(\\xi_1\\approx \\xi(h)\\). Then, we can use it to update the position of \\(x\\) on \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) as\n\\[\nx' = \\varphi(\\exp(\\xi_1),x).\n\\]\nUsing explicit-Euler as the Runge–Kutta method of choice, we have that\n\\[\n\\xi_1 = 0 + h d\\exp_{0}^{-1}\\circ f \\circ \\varphi(\\exp(0),x) = hf(x).\n\\]\nThus, we get the so-called Lie-Euler method as\n\\[\nx' = \\varphi(\\exp(hf(x)),x).\n\\]\nAs a test case, we apply it to the free-rigid body equation that writes\n\\[\n\\dot{z}(t) = z(t) \\times I^{-1}z(t) = X(z(t)),\\quad \\text{with }I = diag(I_1,I_2,I_3).\n\\]\nIt is immediate to notice that \\(z^TX=0\\) for any \\(x\\), by the properties of the \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) cross-product. \\(\\times\\)."
